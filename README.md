🚀 Just launched my new personal project – Udemy Clone!
A simple frontend replica of the popular online learning platform Udemy, built entirely using HTML and CSS.

🔗 Live Demo: https://vickymelwin.github.io/udemy-project/

🎯 Project Highlights:

Clean navbar with search functionality and icons

Category-based navigation (Development, Business, Design, etc.)

“Recommended for you” and “Most Popular” sections with styled course cards

Responsive layout using Flexbox

Organized code structure with reusable CSS classes

Hover effects, custom fonts, and icons (Google Fonts + Font Awesome)

Footer with company and support links

💡 What I Learned:

Structuring large HTML files and organizing CSS efficiently

Using Flexbox for layout design

Styling reusable components with consistency

Mimicking real-world UI designs

📌 Next Steps:

Make the site fully mobile-friendly

Add JavaScript for interactivity (search, filtering, etc.)

Connect with a backend or real course API for dynamic data

Proud of this step in my frontend development journey. More coming soon!
